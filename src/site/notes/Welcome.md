# Welcome !

> Website is under construction right now !

Hey there, welcome to my website.

My name is Zachary, I'm a french student living in Normandy. I'm turning 18 this year (2025), and I'm currently in my 3rd / last year of high school.
I built this site to share my projects, ideas, and the things Iâ€™m learning along the way.

Here you'll find :
- My workflow along the years
- My projects (that are worth writing about, not a lot then)
- Things I like (music, video games, linux, etc...)

Table of contents :
- [[workflow table of content\|workflow table of content]]

Links :
- [My dotfiles](https://github.com/Zachmd14/dotfiles)
