As of 2025-04-21, I recently discovered two apps for task and time managements : [TaskWarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/) and [TimeWarrior](https://timewarrior.net/) (fun fact : they're actually the reason I started writing this website !).

They're both CLI based, I let you find out more on their respective website, here I'm going to focus on how I use them and how I did configure them.
